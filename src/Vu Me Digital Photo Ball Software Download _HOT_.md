But how do you download and use the software that comes with the photo ball? Here are some easy steps to follow.
 
1. First, you need to connect your photo ball to your computer using the USB cable that came with it. Make sure your computer meets the minimum system requirements for the software: Windows XP/Vista/7/8/10 or Mac OS X 10.4 or higher, 512 MB of RAM, and 100 MB of free disk space.
2. Next, you need to install the software from the CD-ROM that came with your photo ball. Insert the CD into your computer's drive and follow the on-screen instructions. If you don't have a CD drive, you can also download the software from the official website: [https://www.vume.com/download](https://www.vume.com/download).
3. Once the software is installed, you can launch it from your desktop or start menu. You will see a main window with four tabs: Photos, Themes, Settings, and Help. You can use these tabs to manage your photo ball and customize it according to your preferences.
4. To add photos to your photo ball, click on the Photos tab and then click on the Add button. You can browse your computer's folders and select the photos you want to upload. You can also drag and drop photos from your desktop or other applications. The software supports JPEG, BMP, PNG, GIF, and TIFF formats.
5. To edit your photos, click on the Edit button next to each photo. You can rotate, crop, resize, flip, or adjust the brightness and contrast of your photos. You can also apply filters, frames, stickers, text, or drawings to enhance your photos.
6. To organize your photos, click on the Organize button at the bottom of the window. You can create albums, sort photos by name, date, size, or rating, and delete unwanted photos. You can also select multiple photos and drag them to rearrange their order.
7. To apply themes to your photo ball, click on the Themes tab and then click on the Apply button next to each theme. You can choose from various themes such as holidays, seasons, animals, sports, etc. Each theme has a different background color and animation effect for your photo ball.
8. To change the settings of your photo ball, click on the Settings tab and then click on the Apply button at the bottom of the window. You can adjust the brightness, contrast, saturation, and speed of your photo ball. You can also set a timer for your photo ball to turn on or off automatically.
